					<h3>Kingdom of the Frogs</h3>
					<p>Far from the situation, I rather enjoyed it. After thoroughly exploring my new premises, I stood at the door, looking at the blue sky above the tall blades of grass.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="arena">
					<h3>Arena</h3>
					<p>My two brothers and I, for instance, lived with her for only two days. On the third day, my mother took each of us to a hole she had dug in the corner of a rice field.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="spiders">
					<h3>Spiders' Den</h3>
					<p>All day long, they quarreled noisily, disputing every tiny shrimp. I could see many skinny egrets, who struggled all day long in the pond but could never get enough to eat.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="ants">
					<h3>Land of the Ants</h3>
					<p>Just then I noticed a cormorant alighting a few steps from where I stood and a wicked idea came into my mind. I called over to  neighbor Choat: "Would you like to have some fun?</p>
				</li>
				<li class="longhorn">
					<h3>Longhorn Hill</h3>
					<p>After a while, I carefully crept up to Choat's hole. When he saw me, my poor neighbour cried out bitterly and I ask stupidly, "What? What happened?</p>
				</li>
				<li class="pineapple">
					<h3>Pineapple Hedge</h3>
					<p>Choat breathed his last. My heart was filled with pity and remorse. Had it not been for the stupid joke I played on the cormorant, Choat would not have died. And I myself had a close shave, too.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="dragonfiles">
					<h3>Village of Dragonflies</h3>
					<p>Near my place lived a small cricket about my age, whom I named Choat (which means tiny). He was born very weak, so I rather looked down on him.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="lagoon">
					<h3>Lagoon</h3>
					<p>I have lived an life since early childhood. Such is the rule among us crickets. My mother used to tell her children, "It's good for you to learn to fly with your own wings.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="reed">
					<h3>Reed Region</h3>
					<p>From that day on, I started life on my own. My personal happiness would depend on whether I would be wise or stupid. But I didn't think of that at the time. I merely enjoyed my independence.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="kingfisher">
					<h3>Kingfisher's Cave</h3>
					<p>All day long, I worked in my hole, enlarging and embe-llishing it into a nice bedroom. Then I dug additional short-cuts and back-doors for emergencies.</p>
